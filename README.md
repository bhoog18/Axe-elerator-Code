# Axe-elerator-Code
This is the final code for our ride for the Iowa State Ride Engineering Competition.

A few of the requirements for the competition were to have our ride lift riders at least 300 mm above their initial starting position, obtain a force of at least 2 G's, and have 32 riders per minute. The code output starts off with the floor motors lowering the floor. This is done so there is no collision with the seats or guests and the floor. Once the floor is down, our code has the arms swinging back and forth in cycles, with each cycle adding additional of pulses to the number of pulses the Arduino is reading. When the arms reach the 7th cycle, they will start going back down and decreasing pulses for every cycle. The seat motors will start rotating when the arms have reached the second cycle going up, and will stop when the arms reach 2 cycles to go. Once the arms have finished the last cycle, they will slowly rotate back until they sense a magnetic sensor. We put a magnetic sensor in so the arms would reset to the same position every time. Sometimes the motors can become un-calibrated, so this solved the issue of having them start and stop at the same position. Once the magnetic sensors were sensed, the floor motors would raise the floor back up. This would complete the ride cycle, which lasts around 44 seconds.
